Corporate history[edit] HelloAmTheVeryVeryVeryLongestWordFindMe

Reputation.com was founded as ReputationDefender by a lawyer, 

Michael Fertik,[1] in 2006.[2] According to Fertik, it was intended 

to help parents after their children reveal too much online, but 

most of his clients were young job-seekers.[3] By 2007 it had grown 

to 55 employees and $2 million in revenue.[4] In January 2010, the 

company changed its name from ReputationDefender to Reputation.com.

[5] In 2011 it was named a Technology Pioneer by the World Economic 

Forum for its effect on society.[6] The company has raised $67 

million in venture capital.[7] As of 2012 it was not making a 

profit.[8]

Services[edit]

Reputation.com is the most well-known online reputation management 

company.[6][7] Its tactics and services vary from one client to 

another and there are separate sets of products for consumers and 

businesses respectively. It may generate monthly reports noting 

changes in search results or ask websites to remove private 

information.[9] In other cases it will generate websites and social 

media profiles that are intended to rank higher in searches than 

negative results. It may also refer some clients to lawyers.[4] The 

company often begins by writing to the operators of websites hosting 

negative content about the client, asking them to remove the 

information.[1] According to the Wall Street Journal, the letters 

"don't make threats... but instead try to appeal to recipients' 

sense of fairness."[1] It generally cannot remove newspapers or 

court records.[10]

The company charges its customers at least $1000 a year for its 

services.[11] In 2007 it introduced a $10,000 service for 

executives.[12] Some of the companyís software includes scoring 

systems used to identify consumer information and generate 

reputation scores for individuals.[8] It has software that locates 

websites where an individualís personal data is unknowingly listed 

and attempt to get it de-listed. It can also track online reviews 

and contact customers to solicit for positive reviews.[13]

Reception[edit]

In 2012, BusinessWeek noted that "Reputation.com scam" was an 

autocompleted phrase when typing the company's name into the Google 

search engine and that many unfavorable search results were hidden 




on the second page of search results for the keyword 

"Reputation.com".[7]

According to The New York Times, Reputation.com is popular, but 

controversial, due to its efforts to remove negative information 

that may be of public interest.[8] According to Susan Crawford, a 

cyberlaw specialist from Cardozo Law School, most websites will 

remove negative content when contacted to avoid litigation.[2] The 

Wall Street Journal noted that in some cases writing a letter to a 

detractor can have un-intended consequences, though the company 

makes an effort to avoid writing to certain website operators that 

are likely to respond negatively.[1] The company's CEO says it 

respects the First Amendment and does not try to remove "genuinely 

newsworthy speech." It generally cannot remove major news stories 

from established publications or court records.[2]

In 2008, former A utoAdmit administrator Anthony Ciolli filed a 

lawsuit against Reputation.com, among other defendants.[14][15] The 

suit was in response to a lawsuit brought against Ciolli by two Yale 

Law School students for being defamed on the Internet message board, 

which is a forum for current and prospective law school students.

[16] Ciolli claims to have lost a job offer as a result of negative 

publicity from the original suit.[16]

In a 2009 paper in the Harvard Journal of Law & Gender, law 

professor Ann Bartow said Reputation.com exploited the harassment of 

women on the internet for media attention.[17]

Two months after the company was founded, ReputationDefender was 

hired to remove online images of 18-year old Nikki Catsouras's 

lethal car accident, which police said was leaked by an officer. The 

company was able to get the images taken down on about 300 out of 

400 websites. The New York Post said their effort was "surprisingly 

effective" but raised concerns that its polite letters were 

resulting in censorship of material offensive to their clients.[6]

[18] Newsweek said it was ineffective. ReputationDefender said 

removing the images was an "unwinnable battle".[19]
